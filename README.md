# RISC5_CPU
This thesis implements a model of a processor with the pipelining technique 
based on the RISC-V architecture. The hardware description language Veri-
log was chosen for the implementation. To confirm the correct operation of 
the model, simulations were performed individually for each instruction 
that can be executed as well as instruction sequences that contained all the 
hazards that can arise. In addition, the design was loaded on an FPGA of 
the Spartan 7 family and it was found that the Synthesis and Implementa-
tion processes were successfully completed.
